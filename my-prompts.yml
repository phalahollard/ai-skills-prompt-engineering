Dear Stakeholder,

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of the initial phase of the new WhatsApp project, I am currently conducting a thorough requirement analysis to ensure we align with business objectives and user expectations. To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your support in providing additional information on the following:

The primary goals and expected outcomes of the project
Key user groups and their specific needs
Any existing documentation or background context
Technical constraints or integration requirements
Timeline expectations and critical milestones
Having this information will enable me to develop a comprehensive analysis and ensure that all requirements are accurately captured and prioritized.

Please let me know if you’d prefer to discuss this in a brief meeting or if there’s someone else I should connect with for these details.

Thank you for your collaboration and support.

Warm regards,
Phala Mathobela
Business Analyst"
